// Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int arr[100], n, x;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    scanf("%d", &x);
    int left = 0, right = n - 1, result = -1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;

        if (arr[mid] >= x) {
            result = mid;    
            right = mid - 1;  
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    printf("%d", result);
    return 0;
}
